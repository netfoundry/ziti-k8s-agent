                          RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                          This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                          For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                          Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                          this init container will be continually restarted on
                          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                          is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                          for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                          completed.

                          Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                          "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                          This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                          "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                          This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                          It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                          Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                          whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                          CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                          "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                          and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                          This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                          All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same

                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                            The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                            - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                            - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                            The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                            A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                            The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                            The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                            The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                            Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                            The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                            must be specified.

                            The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                            the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                            DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                            in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                            also be an IP address.

                            Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                            risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                            which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                            webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                            to turn up in a new cluster.

                            The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                            A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                            a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                            webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                            Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
                            allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not
                            allowed, either.

                        namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests.
                        There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.

                        The exact matching logic is (in order):
                          1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the webhook is skipped.
                          2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the webhook is called.
                          3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE):
                             - If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request
                             - If failurePolicy=Ignore, the error is ignored and the webhook is skipped

                              'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.
                              'request' - Attributes of the admission request(/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest).
                              'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.

                        - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
                        For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,

                        NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based
                        on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                        object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                        object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                        it never skips the webhook.

                        For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                        associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                        follows:
                        "namespaceSelector": {
                          "matchExpressions": [

                        If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose
                        namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                        you will set the selector as follows:
                        "namespaceSelector": {

                              '*/*' means all resources and their subresources.

                              If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
                              overlap with each other.

                        Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with
